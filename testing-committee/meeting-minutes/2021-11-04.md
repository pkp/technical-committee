Prioritization of projects
---------

- Brief discussion on contents of each item

    - do we have some items that could/should be combined?
    - are we missing something?
- Priorization of projects
    - which one's are most important?

    - choose one or two projects? Maybe even 3 if one is less technical?
- Next steps for the chosen projects
    - Upgrade testing
        - Members: Antti-Jussi, Sonja, Alec, Ronald, Andrew
    - Performance testing
        - Members: Alec, Antti-Jussi, Rondinelli
- How to proceed with the remaining items
