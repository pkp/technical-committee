# 6 October 2022

In Attendance
-------------

- Chair: Alec
- Present: Andrew, Alec, Mark, Sonya, Dulip
- Regrets: 

Agenda
------
- Options for small contributions (from Mattermost)
  - Optimization of the PDF view page (from Optimization channel) (Marc)
      - Google analysis identifies slow page -- both time to first byte and time to render.
      - Render time may be unavoidable -- pdf.js. Recommendation may be not to use this if it's important.
  - Try running JMeter (or equivalent) over several "high-profile" operations (e.g. homepage; issue page; about page) to determine relative performance
  - Set up SQL query logging and determine the relative frequency/cost of queries in a dataset test build
  - Potential slow pages:
      - large table of contents (see: https://forum.pkp.sfu.ca/t/how-we-managed-to-optimize-ojs-frontend-for-almost-300-load-speed-free-plugin/70744)
      - listing all issues in issue management
      - searching users site wide in the backend
      - fetching multiple OAI records
      - site wide submissions search in the frontend
  - Timeline: Sometime between now and December (for 3.4)
  - Knowledge needed
      - How do we profile applications in a modern way?
  - Identified candidates for optimization:
    1. Large table of contents (Antti-Jussi)
    2. Investigate JMeter or Apache Benchmark (?) on front-end pages (Andrew)
      - See Marc's conversation in documentation Mattermost channel
      - Could generate documentation on server requirements as an output-         3. Investigate slow time to first byte in article PDF view (Later)
    4. Restructuring mark-up on front end for Google analysis (see Marc on Optimization) (Later)
    5. APM (Application Performance Monitoring) testing (Data Dog/similar tools)
    6. Data sets
        - Discuss requirements / options: small representative datasets, large representative datasets, etc.
    
- Upgrade testing process/documentation (from Mattermost)
    - Andrew has started a summary document from individual practices captured by this committee (thanks particularly to Sonya and Ronald!)
    - "Just use the system" isn't good enough.
    - Recruitment and coordination. Time frame.
    - For 3.4: RC2 is expected in January.
    - Who can start?
        - Sonya, Alec, potentially someone from hosting, Andrew
