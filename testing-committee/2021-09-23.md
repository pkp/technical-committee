1. **Purpose:** (why the group exists)
- Help PKP improve stability and timing of releases and plugins
    - through community testing
    - through technical contributions to PKP's testing infrastructure (e.g. automated tests)
2. **Outcomes for this meeting**
- determine what the main activities of this group will be
    - suggested activities so far: 
        - studying and recommending tools for testing,
        - coordinating testing activities with community members, 
        - maintain and update new admin documentation, 
        - writing tests (or coordinating writing tests with community), 
        - creating / sharing documentation on how to test or how to write tests, 
        - prerelease testing in real production environments,
        - communicate with/survey the community about timelines, schedules, for testing 
        - data validation 
        - upgrade testing
        - performance testing
        - national networks - fostering consortial and national hosting community connections
        - providing guidance on how communities can data share (or share info on how this has worked for other institutions)

- Where should we start?
    - upgrade testing, writing tests
    - performance testing, data validation
    - Question: how to test against a consistent stack?
    - Question: coordinating - how do we help groups come together and do some knowledge sharing
- identify who else should be involved (from within or outside of the PKP organization / community)
    - suggested participants so far: Rondineli (Scielo), someone from Denmark / Netherlands / Sweden networks (could be good candidates for installations that could participate in longer termm testing activities), Andrew Gearhart?
- who would like to lead this group (who is not me!)
- some idea of how this group will function, especially with regards to connecting with PKP development team
- take a look to tools to know what is possible: A preliminary research started [here](https://hackmd.io/GjKd2uQoR12va_A2U81H7g).
- other big questions?
3. **Next steps:**
