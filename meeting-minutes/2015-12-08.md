Release Progress (Alec)
-----------------------

        -   Thanks to Smithsonian, Heidelberg, Free University Berlin, and others for testing/development
    -   Overhauled approvals
    -   Completing refinements of access controls to queries (copyediting, proofreading, etc)

-   OJS 3.0
    -   (Features per OMP 1.2; planning aggressive 3.0 release after OMP 1.2)

    -   Persistent Identifier in OJS 3.0 -- a slightly different UI/UX approach
    -   DOI deposit plugins
    -   Crossref deposit improvement
