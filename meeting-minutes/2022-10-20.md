### What have you been working on lately?

    - pkpContainers: 
        - Rethinking docker-ojs project to
            - Cover any OxS tool.
            - Use OCI standarized images (for docker, k8s, podman...).
            - Improve the historical issues (multi-stage)
            - Take adventage of gitHubActions (CI/CD tools)
    - Course about OJS/OMP:
        - [OJS](https://bit.ly/une-ojs-2022)
        - [OMP](https://bit.ly/une-omp-2022)
        - Valuable feedback about OMP issues/known problems.

    - SciELO Chile OJS *finally* upgraded to OJS 3! -- no more OJS 2 for us, yay!
    - Altmetrics/Dimensions/PlumX badges plugin ported to OPS (with Lepidus)
    - Working on exterminating robot users within the SciELO Brazil OJS (with epidus)
        - Scripts need to evolve with trends in robots
        - They are happy to talk with anyone about strategies
        - Would be a good agenda topic -- lots of interest :)
        - Email bounce-backs are a metric -- can negatively impact domain reputation
            - Using a single sender account can help with this
        - If anyone can identify spammer incentives, please share with PKP.
        - Both user disable and merge tools are helpful (e.g. disable with reason; leave for a long time; if no pushback, merge the account)
        - Clinton / Pittsburgh has plugins and may be interested in subject
        - Patterns identified in forum: https://forum.pkp.sfu.ca/t/collaborative-list-of-spam-user-patterns/65190
    - Pre-moderation plugin using Plaudit for OPS (with Lepidus)
    - SciELO journals pilot migration from ScholarOne to OJS (with Alec)
- **Alec**
    - Security update is out (3.3.0-13)
        - Still need to release latest 3.2.x package
    - Adding PHP8.1 support to stable-3_3_0
    - Foreign keys added to `main` branch DBs (thanks Laravel); will finally start documenting database for publication with SchemaSpy
    - Open reviews! Talk to us!

    - subgroup to work on community testing and documentation with Alec, Andrew G, Jason N, and Erik H.

- **Davin**
    - JATS XML Production
        - Meeting with [MÃ©topes](http://www.metopes.fr/)
        - Internal work on our JATS conversion (Texture JATS4M compatible/inspired)
    - Marc: Need JATS working group? Several groups are interested.
        - Alec: PKP directors need to show leadership (resourcing) before a working group could do much. (to solve editor issue)
        - Davin: What about standardizing a format, irrespective of editor? (e.g. JATS4M)
            - Prerequisite: Home for JATS. https://github.com/pkp/pkp-lib/issues/6825
                - Scheduled for 3.5
            - PKP happy to participate, but OJS is fairly agnostic. Groups with specific requirements need to advocate for shared format.
            - Suggest roping anyone interested into XML channel in Mattermost.
