Release Progress (Alec)
-----------------------

        -   PKP LOCKSS PLN: Some changes merged; this work is very nearly complete
        -   ALM plugin: Some server-side fixes required; these will be done imminently
        -   CrossRef tweaks: Awaiting an update
    -   This may not be released until after the conference unless the last outstanding pieces are finished ASAP.
-   OJS 3.0b
    -   Workflow changes (copyediting) through peer review, some final changes in progress
        -   These will need porting to OMP next
    -   Comprehensive UI changes nearing code review; these look very good
    -   Abbreviated reader front-end work about to commence
-   OMP 1.2
