GPLv2 vs GPLv3 (Alec)
---------------------

Identified some license incompatibilities as we're using GPLv2 for our code and including a mixture of other licenses e.g. for libraries. Cannot simply move to GPLv3 because it's in turn compatible with GPLv2 and at least one tool (plupload) has opted to stay with GPLv2. Continuing research.

Next Meeting
------------

July 8th, normal time; Alec will try to put together a wiki agenda a week beforehand. No news on replacement chair; Alec will inquire.
