Backups to disk (replicated across data centres using commvault software. We have tested and used backups frequently.
        -   Chris (Illinois): local backups, content deposited into institutional repository which is backed up redundantly, including Amazon Glacier

Software License Change
-----------------------

Problem: different licences used, some are GPL 3 compliant, but not GPL 2

Proposals from Brian Owen:

-   Notify previous contributors that PKP will be migrating to GPL 3 with the release of OJS 3.2
-   Confirm that our license statement and related "legal" text is clear, consistent, and current.
-   Implement a Contributor License Agreement (CLA) for all contributions.

Discussion about specific licenses

-   GNU Affero; GPLv3 plus attribution clause; regular GPLv3; others.
