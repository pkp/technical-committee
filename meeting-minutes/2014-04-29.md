-   will be needing to support wider crossref community as part of this, so need to get it right

-   more github pull requests coming in

-   2.4.5 release will be coming out shortly after 2.4.4

-   Columbia working on some OCS development

    -   growing interest in both OMP and OJS, more support responsibilities

    -   mOJO improvement: Now include "mojo user setpwd" and "mojo execute sqlparam 'select username,email from users;'"

Continuous Integration / Testing update (Alec)
----------------------------------------------

-   focus of work since sprint
-   some unit testing - mainly back-end
-   integration testing for front-end
-   travis engine setup now, some sample tests available (log user in, out, etc.)
-   will be smoke testing this week, start recording scripts for auto testing
-   will eventually save us a lot of time, provide a more effective test
-   this will work into our code review practice
-   this is becoming standard practice in OSS development

-   [Travis Testing example](https://travis-ci.org/pkp/omp)
-   [Scrutinizer Testing example](https://scrutinizer-ci.com/g/pkp/omp/) - analyzes every pull request

-   overall, this will improve our software

Review tech committee mandate (Alec)
------------------------------------

-   came out of sprint discussions
-   need for clarification from members around mandate
-   goals are:
    -   to make PKP governance structures reflect community
    -   this group includes dev partner developers + active, trusted developers from community
    -   use quick updates to identify what people are working on, share resources, avoid overlap
-   we should review [existing mandate](https://pkp.sfu.ca/wiki/index.php?title=Technical_Committee) to make sure it is still relevant
-   good to have cross-section of members - like at sprint; can invite more people to this committee
-   think about this and we can discuss further
-   new dev mailing list (let Alec know if you want to join)

UI/UX update (Kevin)
--------------------

-   building on excellent work of [CDL](https://wiki.library.ucsf.edu/download/attachments/321849170/ojs_findings_FINAL.pdf?version=1&modificationDate=1397333875000&api=v2)
-   established a UX Task Group, initially drawing members from PKP developers and support team
-   the current plan is to meet weekly to tackle a critical UX issue in OMP/OJS 3
-   met for the first time last week - topic was the [editorial workflow stages timeline](http://pkp.sfu.ca/wiki/index.php?title=OJS_Workflow:_Stages)
-   brought together all relevant documentation and previous recommendations
-   reviewed and decided
-   looking to first prototype, run past a small set of users, confirm decision
-   this week we'll be discussing the [dashboard](http://pkp.sfu.ca/wiki/index.php?title=OJS_Dashboard)
-   once we have an OJS 3.0beta, will conduct some usability tests to confirm all decisions, make necessary changes before production release

-   look at ways to include community in the process

-   recording process on the [wiki](http://pkp.sfu.ca/wiki/index.php?title=User_Interface_/_User_Experience_Process)
