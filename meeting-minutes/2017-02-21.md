Release Progress (Alec)
-----------------------

-   OJS 3.0.2 out and stable
    -   Still working with one upgrade issue: <http://forum.pkp.sfu.ca/t/upgrade-from-ojs-2-4-7-to-3-0-1-fails/27716>
-   OMP 3.1 due for release March 1st: <https://github.com/pkp/pkp-lib/milestone/17>
-   OJS 3.1 planned for May 1st: <https://github.com/pkp/pkp-lib/milestone/21>
-   OMP and OJS Releases should be synchronized thereafter.
-   Chris questions:
    -   3.x still checks for 2.x updates. In the future, providing more sophisticated update guidance might make sense.
    -   We aren’t providing patch updates for 3.0.x. The policy is that git is preferable—but in that case, we should much more strongly encourage users to install from git in the first place.

Translation (Marco)
-------------------

-   Lots of work being merged on the OJS 3.x line. Thanks, translators! Thanks, Marco!

    -   What is the current state of container-based hosting e.g. for Drupal?
    -   Do OJS 3.x improvements decrease the number of customizations required (e.g. theming)?

    -   Suggest circulating via mailing list.
