        - Stefan from Uni Dresden would like to join. Will likely join next meeting.
    - Chair's handover.
        - Looking for candidates! Please email Marc if you're interested.
        - There's room to shape the role as you like: more directed meetings, less directed meetings...
        - Minimum tasks:
            - prepare the agenda for each monthly meeting,
            - manage membership,
            - prepare summaries for the Advisory Committee and attend to their quarterly meetings
        - Challenges:
            - Finding topics to talk about. Need to be interesting enough for PKP and the group.
        - Opportunities:
            - XML WG participation
            - Feature request management
            - Global representation
            - Clearer roadmap, versions, support, requirements, etc.
    - Hall of fame updating.
    - Proposals to improve...
        - [Existing ToR](https://hackmd.io/kIzxS4bVQbetww69YdIAdQ).
            - Need to continue conversation with TSV
            - A-J: Suggest we keep the delineation of development partnerships firm.
            - Alec: Suggest we create a category for individual exceptional contributors.
                - Davin: Does the support not come from the institution to permit the individual's time to come to us?
            - Ronald: What about individual members invited by the committee? (For specific topics, for a specific period of time?)
            - Agreed on the following proposal:
                - [1->1] PKP Liaison (unchanged)

            - Alec / Ronald : E&I: Not sure about explicit ranking of gender e.g. above geographic diversity. Suggest making diversity a single point. 
            - Marc: Remembers diversity is relevant because define how you think and look into technical solutions, but technical perspective and commitment to Open Science (OA, OC, FLOSS...) comes first. 
            - Alex: Need to be aware of language requirements around English. Might want to be clear about language requirements.
