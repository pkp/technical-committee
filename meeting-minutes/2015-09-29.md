Quick Updates
-------------

-   Marc
    -   Translations: Doing OMP es_ES & ca_ES update and packaging. Git commit before 2nd Oct.
    -   Engage Spanish PKP university community: Very interested in building a regional ALM shared server (to be started with the new year).
    -   Developing resources for the new course for our university OJS-newcomers (for 15th Oct).
    -   Pedagogy with our managers to let them understand that PKP project "is free software BUT need financial support".
-   Bozana
    -   Data privacy for statistics plug-in (OJS and OMP stable): better/correct salt management and information for the users
    -   Shariff plugin for OJS (s. <https://github.com/ojsde/shariff>): social media buttons without compromising the privacy of website users, using Shariff (https://github.com/heiseonline/shariff) solution
    -   Automatic DataCite DOI registration using cron job or Acron plugin
    -   Default translation plug-in: display English texts instead of \#\#...\#\#
    -   Small fixes
-   Dulip
    -   [OMP xMetaDissPlus](http://www.langzeitarchivierung.de/EN/Standardisierung/Metadaten/xMetadissPlus.html) Plugin for German national library is in beta-status
    -   Enhancements to Python based [OMP-Frontend-Protal](http://heiup.uni-heidelberg.de/) with lens-viewer (Multiligual support, Block Citations)
    -   Frontend will be released with GPL-3.
-   Clinton (in absentia)
    -   Was really hoping to get [COUNTER refactoring](https://github.com/pkp/pkp-lib/issues/739) into 2.4.7, but Bruno pointed out an oversight in my PR and I'm out all this week, so that's unlikely to happen.
    -   Working on cleanup of the VTUL EZID plugin, especially [getting it talking to the existing DOI Pub ID settings](https://github.com/VTUL/EzidDOI/issues/3). The inheritance needs a bit of cleanup: EZID clones Crossref is a symlink of Datacite extends DOIExport, which doesn't exist independently. !\#!%?
        -   The above work makes me wonder again about [amending license language](https://github.com/VTUL/EzidDOI/issues/11) for "GPL 2.0 or later". With EzidDOI as an example, if I look at the git commit history for the Crossref plugin, does that give an authoritative list of authorship (and thus a contact group to assent to a license change?)
    -   Hey, it's quiet out here on the [PKP Network Discussion Paper](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1s7i1Uaehp0_SpKFofbwrYGWbr0XijkMh63jwi5oDJKI/edit?pli=1#heading=h.49ectwtcqwfs)!

Release Progress (Alec)

    -   UI/UX changes for OJS 3.0b ported to OMP. Tests fixed. Master branch works again.
