Old Business
------------
* January meeting notes here: https://github.com/pkp/technical-committee/blob/main/meeting-minutes/2022-01-20.md
* REMINDER - call for nominations for new Chair (for a two year term beginning at the April meeting). Deadline February 28!
* LTS announcement and blog post has gone out: https://pkp.sfu.ca/2022/02/15/pkp-announces-long-term-support-lts-software-releases/
* Upgrade blog post ready to go: [removed] (thanks for your feedback!)
    * Comments needs reviewing
* Any updates from the group investigating analytics alternatives? (Marc, Davin, Pierre)
    * Larger discussion scoped down to something small and immediate
    * Two directions:
        * Publish a list alternatives without promising that they are GDPR compliant (e.g. Matomo or perhaps Plausible)
        * What is GDPR compliant (and who has authority to say)? Do we create a subcommittee to establish?
            * May have to develop knowledge around specific tools.
            * Will have local legislation to assess e.g. Quebec/Canada
            * Why do we need e.g. Google Analytics? Why not focus on COUNTER-style analytics?
                * Editors really want these (web stats). They have "good graphs". Prestige and demonstration of impact.
            * A checklist or wizard for journals?
                * starting with "do you really need google analytics?"
                * e.g. data must be hosted in EU, IPs must be anonymized, ...
    * Has Google reacted to GDPR challenge re: Analytics?
    * Bozana is already working on COUNTER/institutional subscription rewrite
    * NGLP is also a player on this.
        * Alec will send A-J details on this.
        * Sonya will share monthly call details.
    * Next steps
        * Ideas
            * Write a very short proposal to communicate as PKP (and send to documentation team to review).
            * Alternatively, going deeper and write down a "howto got statistics without GA" (explaining PKP tools, Plausible integration or Matomo). 
            * finally, if is needed, build plugins for the alternatives.
        * Decision: subgroup will work with Nathalie on communications (e.g. blog post). "If you're worried about GDPR and analytics, here are some altneratives..."
