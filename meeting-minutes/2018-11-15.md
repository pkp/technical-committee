Quick Updates
-------------

-   **Question Every Month**
    -   What have you been working on lately?
        -   Alec:
            -   Dependency clean-up (https://github.com/pkp/pkp-lib/issues/3404) with more to come
            -   SWORD ingest support (collecting use cases), potential part of preprint work
        -   Marc:
            -   Nothing really relevant from the technical side but...
                -   I broke our weblate testing site (will call Marco to find how to fix it).
                -   Still dealing with docker infrastructure (dojo now talks to traefik).
        -   Clinton: Upgrade to OJS3 for Scholarly Exchange (30+ journals in one install with lots of legacy data)
        -   Dulip: lens-bits viewer customizations, ojs plugin, texture plugin
        -   James:
            -   2 new staff undergoing training (mostly systems-related)
            -   Attended CrossRef Live 18; lots of good discussion re: support, documentation, etc
            -   Metadata and XML work mostly for Coalition Publi.ca but with knock-in improvements elsewhere
        -   Kevin: Hiring a communications person; some internal shuffling
        -   Marco: housekeeping (translations), struggling with an OJS3 upgrade and with the texture plugin; HTML galley compliance across upgrade
-   **Question of the Month**
    -   PKP has requested feedback on the proposed creation of a Service Provider Network, with goals of:
        -   helping build communications among service providers
        -   highlighting contributions these providers have made to the community
        -   helping those looking to pay for services to find out about trusted providers
            -   What do you see as opportunities / challenges / risks here?
                -   Reiteration of GPL rights
                -   Wish to steward/guide service provider community
                -   Wish to highlight service providers as an option for groups that aren't aware of it
                -   Some ambiguity over roles, e.g. "member" vs. "service provider" -- document might need a review
                -   Need to watch that this isn't perceived as an indication of publisher or journal quality, but rather service provider
