Question of the Month
---------------------
(deferred until next month)

Other topics
------------
- eLife replacement of Texture
  - With eLife notifying PKP of switching to Prosemirror instead of Texture, this removes the last known viable maintainer for Texture.  PKP will release an additional stability update surrounding Texture tooling, but after that plans will be developed for the replacement of Texture, rather than continued development.
- Development updates
  - OJS, OMP, OPS 3.2.1 dev cycle close to wrap-up
  - Security issue in OJS, OMP prior to 3.2.0: https://github.com/pkp/pkp-lib/issues/5871
