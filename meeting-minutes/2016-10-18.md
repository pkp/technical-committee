Quick Updates
-------------

-   Alec Smecher (PKP)
    -   Another group has come forward (SciFlow via FU Berlin) re: web-based editor integration. Talking API.
-   Clinton Graham (Pitt)
    -   Modeling pluggable, hierarchical authentication: three forms
        -   Internally handled username/password (e.g. LDAP)
        -   Internally handled token authentication (e.g. OAuth)
        -   Webserver based authentication (e.g. Shibboleth)
        -   -   Call for input on any others\*

    -   Modeling locales
        -   Three components: language, country, script
        -   Consider overrides (e.g. en -\> en_US, en_GB; sr -\> sr-Cyrl)
        -   c.f. <https://github.com/pkp/pkp-lib/issues/1858>

Release Progress (Alec)
-----------------------

-   PKP Milestones: <https://github.com/pkp/pkp-lib/milestones>
    -   Provisional dates set
    -   Next release: OJS 3.0.1
        -   OJS 3.0.2 scheduled, receiving most feature-adds, UI/UX tweaks, etc.
        -   OJS 3.0.1 getting most of the bug fixes.
    -   Will be experimenting with labeling/projects to distinguish major features from minor ones

Translation (Marco)
-------------------

-   How to extend xx_YY locale names to support alternate encodings?
    -   interesting discussion on "how to deal with script variants of the same language", see <https://github.com/pkp/pkp-lib/issues/1858>
    -   Proposal: Extend xx_YY to include more detail when available (removing occasional assumptions about its format); use PO-style specifics if possible.
    -   File this for 3.0.2. Meanwhile, the current (sometimes incorrectly-named) translations can be used without digging a deeper hole.
-   translation updates for OJS 3 keep coming in
-   received complete Arabic translation for OJS 3 and the OJS 3 help/documentation
-   work with other translators sometimes slow
-   still no word from fr_CA translators, who is going to get in touch? (Alec will ask Brian to check in)
-   several problems with the translator plugin, would love to have a closer look
-   gitbook workflow works good for translations (OJS 3 user guide needs submodule updates from time to time)
-   still have to find time to talk about new formats and workflows for translations in the future

Documentation (Kevin)
---------------------

-   Documentation working group met; lots of interest. Likely intersection with Documentation blog post from sprint (forthcoming).

UI/UX (Kevin/Alec)
------------------

-   HTML article presentation (for release in OJS 3.0.1): <https://github.com/pkp/pkp-lib/issues/1825>
    -   Merged; simple article view. May need refinement/addition of reading tools, but maybe not if strategic integration (e.g. ORCIDs) prioritized on article landing page.
    -   For release in next OMP and OJS (3.0.1).

Sprint (Alec)
-------------

-   Summary blog post: <https://pkp.sfu.ca/2016/10/18/pkp-fall-2016-sprint-report/>
-   Blog posts should start rolling in for each group (thanks everyone)

Other topics
------------

-   Multilingual/single-field names: Talk next time.
-   OJS 3.0 upgrade tales? Please send them.
-   Talking to big OJS platforms regarding their OJS 3 plans?
    -   Some internal (hosting) RFPs that will permit PKP to work closely with larger content bases
    -   Some performance profiling happening internally (will report)
    -   Otherwise focusing on new/smaller journals (see "should I upgrade" blog post), progress as expected.

Next meeting
------------

-   November 15, 9am Vancouver time.
