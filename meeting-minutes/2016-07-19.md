-   OJS 3.0
    -   Down to 48 issues (currently) from approx. 58 last week
    -   Production UI/UX review to begin approx. August 1st
    -   Translation content from OJS 2.4.*x* merged forward (thanks, Marco!!!)

Help / Manuals (Kevin/Alec)
---------------------------

-   OJS 2.4.8 manual updated
    -   currently in wiki, but plans to move it to GitBook
-   OJS 3.0 built-in help forked from OMP and undergoing active work

Translation (Marco)
-------------------

-   OJS3: building translations on top of OJS2 locales, automatically updated these translations
-   OJS3: expect significant updates (*i.e.*, complete locales) for `ca_ES`, `de_DE`, `es_ES`, expect updates before or after release for `pt_BR`, will have to look further into `fr_CA`
-   OJS2: see above, updated locales, removed redundant code
-   in general: after OJS3 release focus more on recruiting more translators, remove outdated translations, getting translations in better shape
-   translation should be the last issue closed before release, so that translators have time to catch up with final changes in functionality, especially in plugins

UI/UX (Kevin/Alec)
------------------

-   Production stage UI/UX review to begin approx. August 1st
-   CrossRef / permanent identifier work on OJS 3.0 merged and reviewed
-   Chris has feedback from U of Illinois usability lab to share

Sprint (Alec)
-------------
