## Question of the Month
### Are there actions we (TC) can take to help folks running unsupported versions?
* Marc's brainstorm of potential "solutions" or "helpers":
    * More documentation?
    * A high level upgrade-wizard for editors to help them localize their pain areas and get the proper help? 
    * An upgrade "black-box" that gets you mysqldump and your files and returns a new dump and upgraded files in the last stable version?
    * A compilation of well-known errors and their solutions (a troubleshooting DB)?
    * An "upgrade" campaign focused to those specific journals (offering pkp services and a list of organizations that can help them in the upgrade process)?
    * others?
* What do we know about why the community doesn't stay up to date?
    * There is some commentary in beacon presentation with inferences from detailed version data (Slides 27-33, https://dataverse.harvard.edu/file.xhtml?fileId=5378724&version=1.0)
    * Should we do a survey?
        * Unmaintained installs might not result in survey answers.
    * May not be technical:
        * There are unmaintained/abandoned installations in the wild. e.g. where systems and editorial teams are different, editorial group disappears, systems doesn't know.
    * Ideas about why installs might be old:
        * Hardcoded OJS: As far as the code is open, it's quite common to see forked versions of OJS. Once you open the "pandora's box", you never stop and you finish with a frankenstein-ojs that nobody have the courage to touch. And then, it's difficult to keep the track of the changes (think 2.x is before git) and you need to merge manually.
        * I love my theme: Yes, it's a variant of the former one. Some times journal spend some money in a nice theming and now they don't like to lose it.
        * Multiple OJS: If you decided to go with a single-tenant model, you got some benefits, but one big donwside... you need to upgrade multiple ojs.
        * Damaged OJS: Shit happens. Sometimes you get a journal with corrupted files or an inconsistent DB. And it makes the upgrade crazy.
        * Old plugins: If an specific plugin that is essential to you is not released for 3.x, you can not upgrade.
        * Lack of tech resources: In most of the universities I know the IT services are centralized and it's difficult to get their atention in a project that is not in their hands any more. I mean, sometimes would be difficult for a sub-organization that asked for an OJS installation 10 years ago to request an upgrade...
        * A weird error: Long time since OJS 2.x but is not impossible to think that somebody is getting an upgrade error that don't know how to deal with.
        * ...
* Is this work that we should tackle?
    * Dev team (not TC necessarily) needs to protect its time -- there are improvements starting in 3.3 but going back to older versions will be very time-consuming.
