### Highlight of the month: ###

- How do you manage to do integrate OJS within catalogues and long time archives

    - **Martin**
        - Swiss universities operate a central catalog/discovery system based on Alma/Primo called swisscovery, https://swisscovery.slsp.ch . The colleages at SLSP have setup a Primo pipe that harvests the OJS articles via OAI-PMH and the DC metadata format. Example: https://swisscovery.slsp.ch/permalink/41SLSP_UZB/bmqo95/alma99117281089305508
        - The DC metadata format needed some corrections (most important: ISSN shouldn't be part of dc:source, but of dc:identifier, as well as the DOI).
        - The thumbnail of the article in the swisscovery record is created using the ISSN and follows the rule https://www.hope.uzh.ch/journals/{issn}/logo.png
        - On the OJS side, I have set up .htaccess rewrite rules that point to the corresponding thumbnail, e.g.
            ```
            \# Rules for swisscovery
            RewriteCond %{SERVER_NAME} ^www.hope.uzh.ch
            RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
            RewriteRule ^journals/1664-6908/logo.png public/journals/4/journalThumbnail_en_US.png [QSA,L]
            RewriteRule ^journals/1664-6908 https://www.altrelettere.uzh.ch [QSA,L]
            ```
        - For long term archiving, we use PKP PN. LOCKSS did not work reliably.
    - **Marc**
        - Our institutional repository is an invenio that harvest us daily via OAI with a custom script that extracts data from DublinCore and NLM (now JATS) format. Other institutions use SWORD against DSPACE and say they are satisfied.
        - For the long term archive, you can user PKP-PN, LOCKSS, Portico... and we use PKP-PN although (don't tell anyone) I personally prefer a good backup (triplicated and of course on different machines) as it preserves the exact state of the system (the whole workflow) and not just the final materials.
