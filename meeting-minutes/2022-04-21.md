### Highlight of the month: ###

- Knowing Google's practices and with GA declared illegal in some EU countries: should we keep the plugin in the gallery?
    - Proposals:
        - Remove the plugin from the gallery.
        - Add a warning in the plugin description saying that it is illegal in the EU and also warn that it will no longer be updated.
        - Move from plugin specific to "custom header" documentation.
        - Do nothing.
        - ...
    - To take in consideration:
        - https://forum.pkp.sfu.ca/t/google-analytics-update-ga4/72425

    - TC: 
        - General principles for PKP plugins?
            - Hard to make general decisions based on legality. What jurisdiction?
        - PKP Hosting needs this plugin for clients; if PKP doesn't maintain it, Hosting probably will.
        - Second option seems best to the TC.
            - Plugin gallery xml. Visible before installation; can be updated quickly. PR would go to: https://github.com/pkp/plugin-gallery
            - Plugin description. Would need to ship with plugin. 

- Business Intelligence FOSS products for report generation from SQL without SQL knowledge (OLAT tools / Report generating)
    - https://widestage.com/
    - https://www.lincebi.com
    - https://www.knowage-suite.com
    - https://superset.apache.org

- Analytics workgroup?
    - No advances.

- Polling/feature request additions to PKP support forum
    - Related with the GitHub Projects work Alec-Bozana-Nate are doing
        - Could be a good way of capturing/articulating perspectives and priorities from different stakeholders.
        - Perhaps also feature requests from the community?
        - Perhaps an area for items that aren't suitable for PKP to write, but might be grantable?
    - Transparency is important even if resources aren't available yet
    - Alec to present next month with possibilities for representing perspectives in Github projects.
    - Technical Committee supports the addition of a voting tool in the support forum for feature requests.
