Release Progress (Alec)
-----------------------

-   Resourcing setback: Jason overemployed; may affect OJS 3.0b feature target, and OMP 1.2 release date. Sticking with August for OJS 3.0b release.
-   OJS 2.4.x: See Release Automation, below.
-   OMP 1.1.1-1: Generally satisfactory. Features coded but not yet released are starting to stack up (for OMP 1.2).

UI/UX (Alec / Kevin)
--------------------

-   Progress on copyediting workflow (Alec)
-   Looking at a stronger separation between workflow (internal view) and reader (external view) interface (see [early design sketch](http://notthisway.com/temp/pkp-admin-sketches/submission.html))
-   [Profile/registration](http://journals.sfu.ca/uiux/index.php/publicknowledge/user/register) cleanup (Alec)
-   Plugin gallery (Alec)
-   Dashboard rewrite (Bruno)
-   Scoping and design for reader interface (Kevin)

Release Automation (Alec)
-------------------------

Basically ready to try this for OJS 2.4.6-1. No major bugs in OJS 2.4.6 yet, though one annoying one affecting subscription (type) creation.

Translation (Marco)
-------------------

-   We've received and merged a complete OJS translation into Arabic. This required linking to a CSS file for right-to-left languages.

-   I am still interested in using gitbook for documentation and internal help files and will be available for any thought-sharing on that matter (generally and regarding translation options).

-   I am preparing some kind of internal review of existing locales and want to get in touch with translators about completing translations and fixing errors.

Documentation (Kevin)
---------------------

-   [Gitbook](https://www.gitbook.com/@pkp) documentation to replace internal application help files
-   supports multiple versions, [multiple languages](http://pkp.gitbooks.io/ojs3/content/)
-   basis for spin-off documentation (e.g., detailed user manuals, etc.)

Community Forum (Alec/Kevin)
----------------------------

-   Some spam appearing; annoying but not prohibitive
-   Recently added tagging plugin for OJS/OMP/OCS/OHS
-   Added a FAQ area and will begin populating it, hopefully permitting the removal of various scattered/poorly-maintained FAQs elsewhere

Next Meeting
