Alec, Bartek, Clinton, Jason, Jeanette, Kevin, Marc, Marco

Quick Updates
-------------

-   Clinton Graham (Pitt)
    -   Retooling plugins/reports/counter
        -   Allow multiple COUNTER releases
            -   ~~new Counter class; Counter3 implements Counter, Counter4 implements Counter~~
            -   new CounterRelease class; CounterRelease3 implements CounterRelease; CounterRelease4_1 implements CounterRelease
        -   Allow multiple COUNTER reports per release
            -   ~~new JR1_r3 implements Counter3, new AR1_r4 implements Counter4~~
            -   new JR1_r3 implements CounterRelease3, new AR1_r4_1 implements CounterRelease4_1
            -   Each report provides methods getMetricsXML() and getErrors(), among others
        -   Allow plugin to enumerate available reports
    -   SUSHI-Lite plugin (plugins/generic/sushiLite) can thus:
        -   take in parameters of the report and release
        -   verify the availability of the report in plugins/reports/counter
        -   attempt execution
        -   deliver response of data and/or error conditions

-   Alec
    -   Meeting with Bozana et al this week, grant funding available

-   Jason
    -   Working on AAA plugin; almost done - on to UI/UX changes

-   Marc
    -   Update some OJS themes to 2.4.5 (noticed that we have a lack on HTML/CSS coding styles and good pratices)
    -   Working with OMP es_ES and ca_ES translators (starting process)
    -   Update es_ES wiki to fit Marco's translation page proposal.

-   Bartek
    -   Looking at using OJS as an open access megajournal, with Canadian Science Publishers
    -   Modifications not too huge; not looking at using workflow, so we could look at using OJS 3 codebase

Release Progress (Alec)
-----------------------

-   OMP 1.1.1 released: <https://pkp.sfu.ca/omp-1-1-1-released/>
-   OJS 2.4.6 in progress with brief release cycle planned
    -   stats work still in progress
    -   otherwise, almost ready to go
    -   short translation round, or skip it
    -   Bugzilla bugs: <http://pkp.sfu.ca/bugzilla/buglist.cgi?bug_status=NEW&bug_status=ASSIGNED&bug_status=REOPENED&list_id=5780&product=OJS&query_format=advanced&version=2.4.6>
    -   Github issues: <https://github.com/pkp/pkp-lib/milestones/OJS%202.4.6>
-   OJS 3.0 / OMP 1.2 development continues

UI/UX (Alec / Kevin)
--------------------

-   User feedback has come back positive about moving to an online discussion-based format for copyediting communication
-   Now looking at how to integrate that approach into production and review
-   Getting close to scheduling release dates for a second alpha, a beta, and ultimately a production release of OJS 3
-   Working with Bozana on reader interface work
-   Working with John Willinsky on initial design of reader interface

New Forum Demo
--------------

-   We've reviewed a number of possible phpbb replacements for our current forum and like the look of [Discourse](http://www.discourse.org/) (used by [Boing Boing](http://bbs.boingboing.net/), for example}.
-   Here's our demo: [<http://lib-pel7dev.lib.sfu.ca/>](http://lib-pel7dev.lib.sfu.ca/)
-   We're also rethinking the categories, moving away from separate application categories or attempts at distinguishing between technical and non-technical questions
-   Feel free to create an account and mess around
-   Google, Facebook, Twitter, and Github logins are possible

Recommended Patches List
------------------------

-   Some progress in solving DB issues (simple answer: scheduled releases won't do them)
-   Need to add scheduled release information to version data; we currently only support w.x.y-z
    -   Can we use z as week number?
    -   How frequent? Weekly, monthly, quarterly?
    -   Alec will consult with James, who manages our hosting installations out of github
-   Upgrade test suite will become possible with OJS 2.4.6 (as we'll have two successive releases with CI DB available)
-   Better automation of build process will become possible after OJS 2.4.6 (as we'll have completed the transition to git issues from Bugzilla)

Markup Best Practices
---------------------

See e.g. <http://pkp.sfu.ca/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=9035> for discussion

-   Need better use of HTML in OJS (especially looking toward OJS 3)
-   Style guide / coding standards to help coders with better code for PKP
-   Link it into live examples of best practices (i.e., an exemplar plugin)
-   Marc will start a thread on the new forum
-   Alec will link to any existing documents
