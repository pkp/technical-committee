In Attendance
-------------

Alec, Chris, Clinton, Dulip, Jeanette, Kenton, Marc, Marco, Svantje

Welcome, Svantje!

Quick Updates
-------------

-   Clinton Graham (Pitt)
    -   Vetting API changes (e.g. `Article::getStartingPage()`)
        -   Alec: Better to do now than later. Tag in Doxygen to highlight the change? Used in several plugins…
        -   Clinton: Aware of plugin usages, most of them seem incorrect. Will look into Doxygen tags.
    -   Any memory of "Resubmit Statistics" (aka `submissionsRevise`)?
        -   Alec: Send me more info, will look into it.

Release Progress (Alec)
-----------------------

-   OJS 2.4.8-2: Soon, but not yet
    -   security issue concerning journal managers
-   OJS 3.0.2: Scheduled for Feb 1
    -   Significant progress on translations; upgrade tweaks/fixes; etc.
-   OMP 3.1: Scheduled for March 1
    -   harmonizing release number with OJS
    -   several new features
-   OJS 3.1: Scheduled (tentatively) for May 1
    -   To include major features, including subscriptions

See <https://github.com/pkp/pkp-lib/milestones> for all milestones.

-   an issue can only have one milestone in GitHub, which is a bit awkward

Translation (Marco)
-------------------

-   some problems with the translation server
    -   expect translation updates for OJS 2.4.8-2, OJS 3.0.2 (Marco will send updates soon)
    -   M will come up with a plan on how to proceed with the translation install
-   OJS 3 translations: Arabic (see RTL issues), Russian, French (under review)
-   expect Finnish translation, German update
-   major translation updates come in via GitHub, much much easier to maintain
    -   working via translation servers has some communication challenges
-   planning for next release
    -   Alec has plans… but talks too fast to minute

Documentation (Kevin)
---------------------

UI/UX (Kevin/Alec)
------------------

-   some discussion about processes: Kevin collects feedback from reviews, common issues pulled into a spreadsheet with priorities etc.
-   still figuring out how to go from spreadsheet to GitHub
-   want to make sure that UI/UX feedback gets more attention than random feature requests
-   GitHub manifestations of UI/UX testing may link to Google Docs; ask for access if you need it

Javascript Framework / Future Plans (Alec)
------------------------------------------

-   Some Javascript foundational work is under early discussion within the team
    -   encapsulation of objects makes inter-widget interaction troublesome; messaging is needed
    -   interaction between handlers and DOM is 1-to-1; MVC direction seems better, requires more separation
-   Call for comments on tools & approaches
    -   Kenton supports Vue
    -   ongoing discussion in [Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BUPgmN4yFxHxlE_8kbFvWUGg0Ve5PdosOngpitP5NUc/edit#heading=h.qxwb07qwfxi6)
    -   Dulip likes Vue and React
        -   Alec notes Vue2
    -   Alec says someone else (who?) supports Backbone
    -   Marc likes Vue

Other topics
------------

### Versioning for published articles (Svantje)

-   Tab view (https://github.com/pkp/pkp-lib/issues/2072) implemented (https://github.com/lilients/ojs)
-   Galleys connected with article version (“submission revision”)
-   Current task: create new (unpublished) version from tab
    -   Marco: if we allow editing of published content, editors will do it; we will be encouraging that.
    -   Alec: don’t be afraid to track multiple revisions; store everything, maybe with a minor-change flag like MediaWiki.
    -   Svantje: how would we do major/minor? (Alec: just a Boolean flag)
-   `EditorDecision` handler vs. own handler?
    -   Alec: continue down whatever path you’ve started, and we’ll see in code review how it’s going
-   changes at the database: add `submission_revision` to `published_submissions`? (currently only at `submission_settings`)
    -   Alec posts SQL suggestion in Hangout chat
-   timeline concerns: Svantje and Alec will work to make sure it gets done in her available time frame

### Locale names (Marco)

-   no solution for longer locale names yet, so we have unmerged translation updates
-   need those to support different encodings/scripts (e.g. Cyrillic and Latin alphabet)
-   see issue <https://github.com/pkp/pkp-lib/issues/1911>
-   any update?
-   Kassim is working on this

### Sending passwords in plaintext e-mail (Marco)

-   known problem
-   moving away from it, toward just reset-required passwords
-   <https://github.com/pkp/pkp-lib/issues/2135>

### OJS 2.x lifecycle (Svantje)

-   Alec: Indefinite; we’ll support 2.x until 3.x has full support for 2.x features like subscription, PubMed plugin, etc. Will then recommend 3.x for new projects, and wind down support over a year or two…
-   Will need to back-port PHP 7 support to OJS 2.x
