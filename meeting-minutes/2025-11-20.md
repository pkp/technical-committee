- **Emily**
    - Open Access Week Carnival/workshops ([Price of Knowledge quiz](https://usask.libwizard.com/f/price-of-knowledge))
    - Meetings with MC about Feature requests
    - Investigating XML publishing workflows for [Library Freedom Journal](https://ojs.library.queensu.ca/index.php/lfj/index) (thanks those who weighed in on Mattermost!)
    - finished teaching most recent round for ALA Repositories course

- **Martin**
    - mostly engaged with UZH publication repository migration issues (e.g. processing 180 million accesses for statistics, presentations of project at various meetings), not much time for OJS
    - Theme changes for multilingual display of a journal (OJS 3.4.0-9)
    - Porting a status filter for submissions developed by my colleague Kristian to a OJS 3.4 journal
    - testing publication facts label plugin - it crashes with imported publications
    - onboarding meetings for K8s OJS / OMP container hosting

- **Marc**
    - Working with [MejorAbierta](https://github.com/MejorAbierta/) fellows (ARTS plugin it's promising).
    - Finishing Toolkit with CRAFT-OA.
    - Dealing with Drupal upgrade (always even harder than OJS).

- **Ronald**
    - OJS 3.5 plugin upgrades
    - SeDOA XML-workflow business (e.g. establishing am XML discussion group)
    - New SeDOA (German Diamond OA Capacity Hub) coworker to develop on XML worflows and in particular to improve Pandoc (first commit already done)

- **Sebastian**
    - Working with Nate on the [IndividualizeTheme](https://github.com/NateWr/individualizeTheme) until End of Year
    - Experimenting with Author Contract Generation in OJS
        - Alec: OJS/OMP/OPS 3.5.0+ contain MPDF already for PDF export of peer reviews -- see `lib/pkp/api/v1/reviews/PKPReviewController.php` in the `generatePDF` function

- **Alec**
    - Releasing OJS, OMP, OPS builds for 3.3, 3.4, 3.5 today/tomorrow
        - There are some XSS / security fixes (nothing super critical but worth releasing/upgrading)
        - 3.5 release will be 3.5.0-2; expecting LTS stamp to go on 3.5.0-3.
    - Lots of internal silo-breaking conversations!
        - Plugin maintenance
        - Release management
        - Prioritization
        - Email delivery


Agenda
------
- review updates
- Alec: typesetting/body text options
- Emily: Feature Requests Working Group planning and discussion
    - questions from previous meeting with MC: (google docs link removed)
    - notes Emma took: (google docs link removed)
    - I will be at senior staff meeting later in the day to discuss who should be involved and how we will operate so it would be great to summarize some key points from TC perspective
- Updates and additions to the discussion topics list -- can we eliminate or consolidate any topics, or define more clearly what our goals are for the discussions?

Notes
-----

### Typesetting body text options
Review of body text editing plans and various conversions; more to come via the Production Workflows working group (PKP + various community stakeholders) followed by workshops and webinars (external)

Old Business

Other topics
------------

I think Alec's topic and some feature requests discussion would be helpful so those will make the agenda -- it would be great if we could summarize the FR situation a bit from our perspective -- but here are all the topics proposed! maybe tomorrow we can have a brief chat about if all of these should be on our list or if some will be taken care of elsewhere but here they are for now:

:one: (In progress) How to show OxS requirements?: php version, php plugins, HW requirements…
:two: Core vs. Plugin-Approaches for new features. 
:three: Open Repositories integrations (SignPosting, FAIRiCat, COARNotify).
:four: Ideas for the Health Check plugin.
:five: Research integrity checks (e.g., looking for papermills, suspicious activies (author and reviewer being the same person), fast journal turnaround (peer review happening too quickly)**
:six: [plugin API endpoints](https://mattermost.publicknowledgeproject.org/pkp/pl/4idzz8ths7dc8er8b1qc719dsc) (by Nate).
:seven: personal data preservation & GDPR (by AJ).
:eight: [SBOM](https://forum.pkp.sfu.ca/t/software-bill-of-materials-sbom/95822/13?u=marc) (by Jon)
:nine: FAQs management (by Marc)
:keycap_ten:  [OxS decoupling and 12 factors](https://forum.pkp.sfu.ca/t/decoupling-the-application-for-cloud-native-development-and-deployment-scenarios-according-to-the-twelve-factors-12factor-net/97143/3) (by Jon)
:page_with_curl: ToR update
:electric_plug: metadata and plugins (started by Juan I think) -- FWIW when this was discussed it sounded like Mike wanted to follow up on something about funder metadata before we discussed further but I can check in with him
:books: OMP terminology (and redefinition).
