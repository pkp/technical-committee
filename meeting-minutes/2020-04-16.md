Question of the Month
---------------------
### Strategic Partnerships
> Every PKP relationship has a strategic element, but it is a primary focus with these partners. Partnership examples include institutions, publishers, and other agencies that have an ongoing consultative relationship with PKP and closely aligned strategic goals. Collaborative activities are wide ranging and may include some or all of the following: collaboration on research projects, development contributions to PKP software; provision of language translations; assistance with software documentation, learning material or technical support; joint workshops, seminars or conference presentations; participation in UI/UX and PKP software testing; shared advocacy initiatives, or any appropriate activity that contributes to advancements in the scholarly publishing environment.

* What are success stories?
    * Heidelberg (e.g. ORCID Profile plugin) - shared development effort
    * Examples of ongoing relationship, with understanding of ongoing work, even without developer contribution
        * Crossref
        * ORCID
    * Collaborations within Strategic Partners (FUB - Heidelberg)
* What are gaps?
    * Interesting work, but lacking developer resources
        * NISO - SUSHI, PIE-J
        * CASRAI - CRediT
* Are there points at which Partners should be removed from the list?
    * What is our goal for this list? (promotional / relational / ???)
    * Alec will inquire of Directors regarding renewals (or formal agreements?) with Partners

Other topics
------------
- PKP Managing Director hire!
    - posted, search in process
- Slack history limitations
    - We could...
        - Subscribe?
        - Transition to another tool (Mattermost?)
        - Add a formal knowledgebase?
            - port solutions to Forum FAQ or Documentation Hub?
            - internally some members already do this with their own wikis (seeing Slack as stictly communication)
    - SciELO was able to negotiate a substantial discount for Slack.
    - Can we export Slack content in future if we move to other tool?
        - Mattermost can import from slack. 
    - James was exploring the Mattermost migration.
        - is there anything we would miss in this change? Seems like we are using vanilla Slack, so we don't anticipate missing anything.
