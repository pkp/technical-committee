        - Alec to come up with a strategy on better integration of CVEs into PKP's internal process -- reduce noise with multiple places to look.
    - Plugin community, updates, and sustainability coming up internally -- likely to arise here too.

Agenda
------
- review quick updates -- Craft OA!
- Welcome Carolina
- Update on meeting with Members Committee re: Feature Requests working group
- Topic #1: OsX requirements
- Topic #4: Health Check plug in

Notes
-----

- Topic #1: OsX requirements
    - Alec: Better show ojs versions. A proof of concept was done with the gantt diagram but we have an issue with the license. Going ahead as we are acting in good faith.
    - Text explanation is ready and will be published soon.
    - Requirements included in [composer](https://github.com/pkp/pkp-lib/blob/main/composer.json) and in the [repo README](https://github.com/pkp/ojs)
    - LTS page draft doc: https://hackmd.io/YOfEL0KdRwiV7wz2_TXA-w
- Topic #4: Health Check plug in
    - CP / PKP team is working on a plugin for Coalition Publica; this will likely serve as a good template for others.
    - Additional brainstorm ideas:
        - **Server Environment**
          - PHP version and required extensions compatibility.
          - Correct permissions in `public/`, `cache/`, `files_dir/`.
          - Disk space, `memory_limit`, and `max_execution_time`.
          - Valid HTTPS configuration and SSL certificate.
          - URL redirections (ensure main endpoints exists)
        - **Database Integrity**
          - Check for missing or broken keys and indexes.
          - Detect duplicate records and orphaned references.
          - Ensure schema consistency with the installed OJS version. 
          - Periodic table optimization.
        - **File Integrity**
          - Match between database records and `files_dir` content.
          - Verify permissions and ensure no public HTTP access.
          - Validate hashes or checksums of critical files (`config.inc.php`).
        - **System Configuration**
          - Validate `config.inc.php` "version". Check values and external executable paths.
          - Verify scheduled tasks (*cron jobs*).
          - Check integrity of `registry/` and `locale/` directories.
        - **Plugin Compatibility**
          - Confirm plugin compatibility with the current OJS version (or run the pugin in a try-catch)
          - Identify obsolete or conflicting plugins.
          - Verify plugin origin or digital signature.
        - **Installation Health and Performance**
          - Measure frontend and backend response times.
          - Check cache status and error logs.
          - Verify PKP PN indexing and outgoing mail queue size.
        - **Pre-upgrade Checks**
          - Ensure recent database and file backups.
          - Confirm consistent DB schema versions across all journals.
          - Run upgrade *dry test* and validate migration scripts.
        - **Editorial Data Integrity**
          - Detect inconsistent submission or article states.
          - Check for incomplete or invalid metadata (DOI, ORCID).
          - Identify stalled or overdue editorial tasks.
    - Alec: Many of these are technical in nature; purpose of health check could also be editorial.
        - Many of the tech elements represent common pitfalls -- maybe invest time in building a bridge over the pit, rather than dropping a ladder in :)
        - Sidebar: dev leads are talking internally about a technical roadmap. Current roadmaps are feature driven, and technical roadmap is not well articulated anywhere. More to come.

Sentry -- Sentry support was added here for release in 3.6; it'll be easy to back-port: https://github.com/pkp/pkp-lib/issues/11875
